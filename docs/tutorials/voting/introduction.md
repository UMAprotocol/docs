Recommended reading - [UMA holder responsibilities](governance/uma-holders.md)

As an UMA holder you have the opportunity to participate in the governance of the UMA protocol. You can vote on UMIPs (UMA Improvement Proposals) or price requests to the DVM.

You are incentived by a reward for each vote you make paid out in UMA equal to  
  total UMA tokens x 0.05% x # UMA tokens you hold / total # UMA tokens held by everyone who voted

This reward is given for each vote you succesfully revealed.
Rewards should be claimed and are not dispersed. There is no time limitation on when rewards can be claimed.

(2020-10-11)
On average 25M to 35M tokens participate in voting. This means your reward is around  
50k x # UMA tokens you hold / (25M to 35M)

(2020-10-11) The gas fees for voting are currently being paid back, more info [here](https://medium.com/uma-project/voter-gas-fee-rebate-program-f9cce3391cb5).


### How can I vote?

Another option is to follow the [discord announcements channel](https://discord.com/channels/718590743446290492/718593298675007741).


### What do I have to vote on?
- [UMIPs](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs) - UMA Improvement Proposals  These UMIPs are discussed by the community in temporary discord channels.

- Price requests -
When a liquidation is disputed or an UMA financial smart contract terminates the identifier price is requested on-chain. You as a UMA voter will bring this price on-chain.

### How to find the price which you should provide in the voting dApp?
UMA holders discuss about the price request in the discord voting channel. If you add and vote for a price that is not the same as the consensus price you will not be rewarded UMA tokens. 
You can validate the proposed prices with the following tools:
