To immediately start building on the UMA protocol, first check out the [Quick Start guide](/developers/setup) for setting up your environment and deploying your first synthetic token.

The tutorials in this section are written to use the Expiring MultiParty (EMP) contract, which is the first available production ready template of a synthetic token. The EMP allows developers to quickly launch expiring synthetic tokens, such as the [UMA yield dollar](/users/mint-farm-yusd), but is by no means a limitation on the types of synthetic tokens that a developer could create.

### Complete build process

After following the quick start guide and deploying your first synthetic token, you can follow this general build process to launch and secure a mainnet version of your expiring synthetic token.

1. [Finalize your contract design.](/synthetic-tokens/explainer)
2. [Apply to the UMA developer mining program.](/developers/developer-mining)
3. [Propose a new price identifier or collateral type.](/uma-tokenholders/adding-price-id)
4. [Deploy your contract.](/build-walkthrough/mint-locally)
5. [Mint your first synthetic tokens.](/build-walkthrough/minting-etherscan)
6. [Deploy liquidator and dispute bots to secure your contract.](/developers/bots)
7. [Finalize your developer mining and start receiving rewards.](/developers/devmining-reqs)

It is highly recommended that you perform steps 4-6 on Kovan before moving to mainnet.
