To deploy a synthetic token and start receiving developer mining rewards, it recommended that you follow the docs tutorials in this order.

1. [Create your first synthetic token.](/build-walkthrough/mint-locally)
2. [Finalize your contract design.](/synthetic-tokens/explainer)
3. [Apply to the UMA developer mining program.](/developers/developer-mining)
4. [Propose a new price identifier or collateral type.](/uma-tokenholders/adding-price-id)
5. [Deploy your contract on Kovan.](/build-walkthrough/mint-locally)
6. [Mint your first synthetic tokens.](/build-walkthrough/minting-etherscan)
7. [Deploy liquidator and dispute bots to secure your contract.](/developers/bots)
8. [Deploy your contract on mainnet.](/build-walkthrough/mint-locally)
9. [Finalize your developer mining and start receiving rewards.](/developers/devmining-reqs)

It is highly recommended that you preform steps 5-7 on Kovan before moving to mainnet.
