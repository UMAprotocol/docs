## What are synthetic tokens?

Synthetic tokens are collateral-backed tokens whose value fluctuates depending on the tokensâ€™ reference index. Synthetic tokens blend features of prediction markets, futures markets, and collateralized loans.

Some examples of synthetic tokens include:

* Synthetic real-world assets (eg: gold or Tesla stock price)
* Synthetic cross-chain cryptoassets
* Tracking tokens for various non-tradable indices

Some of the most creative ideas for synthetic tokens fall in the last category. Check out the discussion on Discord for more project ideas like:

* Tokens that track the future usage of DeFi projects (e.g. assets locked in Uniswap)
* Tokens that track the number of downloads of a Chrome extension (e.g. Metamask)
* Tokens that track the success of trade ideas on r/WallStreetBets

By changing the price identifier of a priceless synthetic token, you can create synthetic tokens that behave like tokenized versions of other derivatives, like options.
