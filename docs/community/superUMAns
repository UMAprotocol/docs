## What is a SuperUMAns?

SuperUMAns are the community's ninja troops.  They know how powerful UMA is, the kinds of things that UMA can be used for and they are determined to spread the word.

## Who can become a SuperUMAn?
SuperUMAns come from all walks of life. Maybe you have accidentally found your way to UMA, wanting to try a little bit of everything, and need somewhere for your endless curiosity and passion for questioning the status quo and asking “what if” questions. On UMA’s discord boards, the “what ifs” are always encouraged to try to build something, better, stronger, quicker,

This isn’t just a place for crypto lovers to hang out- although we have plenty of folks here who would self-identify that way. This is a place where multi-talented people come together to push the boundaries of what’s possible in DeFi, with the intention of building a market that is truly universally accessible to anyone.

SuperUMAns are the people who bring this community to life. They’re the folks with a deep desire to participate in building something bigger than themselves. They feel drawn to the crypto ecosystem because of the potential they see, they believe UMA provides some amazing tools to help build the future of DeFi and they want to share this with the world

*Sound at all like you?
If so, you just may be a superUMAN.*
