This section explains the UMA Subgraph and how to interact with it. The UMA subgraph indexes data from the UMA contracts over time. It organizes data about tokenholders, contracts, DVM requests, and more. The subgraph updates any time a transaction is made on UMA. The subgraph runs on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) protocol’s hosted service and can be openly queried.

## Resources

- [Sandbox](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/protofire/uma) for querying data for developers.
- [Sandbox](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/umaprotocol/uma-kovan) for querying data on Kovan.
- [Source code](https://github.com/protofire/uma-subgraph) for deployed subgraph.

## Making Queries

To learn more about querying a subgraph refer to [The Graph’s documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/introduction).
