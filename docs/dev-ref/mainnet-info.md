## Current DVM Parameters

The current DVM parameters are as follows. The parameters can be adjusted via
the introduction of a new [UMIP](uma-tokenholders/umips.md).

1. Inflation percentage per vote: 0.05%

   The token supply is inflated on each resolved vote. If the inflation rate is
   5%, then that 5% is split pro rata amongst those who voted correctly. This
   means that on a per-voter basis, the rewards are >= 5% (i.e. you get more if
   fewer people vote).

2. GAT: 5%

   This is the minimum % of tokens that need to participate in a vote for the
   vote to resolve and not be rolled to the next round of voting. This cannot be
   changed without upgrading Voting.sol.

3. Voting phase length: 24 hours

   Commit and reveal are phases, so this means a _round_ of voting will take
   twice as long as a phase. This cannot be changed without upgrading
   Voting.sol.

4. Contract tax rate per annum: 0.0%

5. Tax delay penalty per week: 0%
