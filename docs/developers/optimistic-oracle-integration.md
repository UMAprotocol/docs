This demo will set up an `OptimisticDepositBox` contract which custodies a userâ€™s ERC-20 token balance.

On a local testnet blockchain, the user will deposit wETH (Wrapped Ether) into the contract and withdraw wETH denominated in USD. For example, if the user wants to withdraw $10,000 USD of wETH, and the ETH/USD exchange rate is $2,000, they would withdraw 5 wETH.

* The user links the `OptimisticDepositBox` with one of the price identifiers enabled on the DVM.

* The user deposits wETH into the `OptimisticDepositBox` and register it with the `ETH/USD` price identifier.

* The user can now withdraw a USD-denominated amount of wETH from their `DepositBox` via smart contract calls, with the Optimistic Oracle enabling optimistic on-chain pricing.

In this example, the user would not have been able to transfer USD-denominated amounts of wETH without referencing an off-chain `ETH/USD` price feed. The Optimistic Oracle therefore enables the user to "pull" a reference price.

Unlike price requests to the DVM, a price request to the Optimistic Oracle can be resolved within a specified liveness window if there are no disputes, which can be significantly shorter than the DVM voting period. The liveness window is configurable, but is typically two hours, compared to 2-3 days for settlement via the DVM.

The price requestor is not currently required to pay fees to the DVM. The requestor can offer a reward for the proposer who responds to a price request, but the reward value is set to `0` in this example.

The price proposer posts a bond along with their price, which will be refunded if the price is not disputed, or if a dispute is resolved in the proposer's favor. Otherwise, this bond is used to pay the final fee to the DVM and pay a reward to a successful disputer.

In the demo, the requestor does not require an additional bond from the price proposer, so the total bond posted is equal to the [wETH final fee](uma-tokenholders/approved-collateral-currencies.md), currently 0.2 wETH. See the `proposePriceFor` function in the `OptimisticOracle` [contract](https://docs-dot-uma-protocol.appspot.com/uma/contracts/OptimisticOracle.html) for implementation details.

## Running the Demo

1. Ensure that you have followed all the prerequisite setup steps [here](developers/setup.md).
2. Run a local Ganache instance (i.e. not Kovan/Ropsten/Rinkeby/Mainnet) with `yarn ganache-cli --port 9545`
3. In another window, migrate the contracts by running the following command:

```bash
yarn truffle migrate --reset --network test
```

1. To deploy the `OptimisticDepositBox` [contract](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/core/contracts/financial-templates/demo/OptimisticDepositBox.sol) and go through a simple user flow, run the following demo script from the root of the repo:

```bash
yarn truffle exec ./packages/core/scripts/demo/OptimisticDepositBox.js --network test
```

You should see the following output:

```
1. Deploying new OptimisticDepositBox
  - Using wETH as collateral token
  - Pricefeed identifier for ETH/USD is whitelisted
  - Collateral address for wETH is whitelisted
  - Deployed an OptimisticOracle
  - Deployed a new OptimisticDepositBox


2. Minting ERC20 to user and giving OptimisticDepositBox allowance to transfer collateral
  - Converted 10 ETH into wETH
  - User's wETH balance: 10
  - Increased OptimisticDepositBox allowance to spend wETH
  - Contract's wETH allowance: 10


3. Depositing ERC20 into the OptimisticDepositBox
  - Deposited 10 wETH into the OptimisticDepositBox
  - User's deposit balance: 10
  - Total deposit balance: 10
  - User's wETH balance: 0


4. Withdrawing ERC20 from OptimisticDepositBox
  - Submitted a withdrawal request for 10000 USD of wETH
  - Proposed a price of 2000000000000000000000 ETH/USD
  - Fast-forwarded the Optimistic Oracle and Optimistic Deposit Box to after the liveness window so we can settle.
  - New OO time is [fast-forwarded timestamp]
  - New ODB time is [fast-forwarded timestamp]
  - Executed withdrawal. This also settles and gets the resolved price within the withdrawal function.
  - User's deposit balance: 5
  - Total deposit balance: 5
  - User's wETH balance: 5
```

## Explaining the Contract Functions

It is worthwhile to examine the `OptimisticDepositBox` [contract code](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/core/contracts/financial-templates/demo/OptimisticDepositBox.sol) to see how it interacts with the UMA protocol.

The `constructor` function includes a `_finderAddress` argument for the UMA `Finder` contract, which maintains a registry of the `OptimisticOracle` address, approved collateral and price identifier whitelists, and other important contract addresses.

This allows the `constructor` to check that the collateral type and price identifier are valid, and allows the `OptimisticDepositBox` to find and interact with the `OptimisticOracle` later.

The `requestWithdrawal` function includes an internal call to the `OptimisticOracle` requesting the `ETH/USD` price. Once it's returned, the user can call `executeWithdrawal` to complete the withdrawal.

There is much more information and explanation in the code comments, so please take a look if you're interested in learning more!

## Extending the Example Contract

While the example contract uses wETH as the currency for deposits to the `OptimisticDepositBox` and ETH/USD as the price identifier, the code supports use of any [approved ERC-20 token](uma-tokenholders/approved-collateral-currencies.md) as the currency for deposits.

The code can also be deployed with any other [price identifier](uma-tokenholders/approved-price-identifiers.md) approved by UMA governance. For example, if users wanted to denominate their withdrawals in BTC instead of USD, the price identifier could be set to ETH/BTC.

This example is intended to serve as a basic technical tutorial for how to integrate the Optimistic Oracle into a new contract. Some interesting ideas for extending the example contract include:

- Limiting withdrawals unless ETH is above a certain USD price, which would enforce a "HODL" strategy for depositors.
- Allowing a user to request a price and propose a price in the same transaction.
- Only allowing withdrawals after a specified future timestamp.
- Allowing partial withdrawals denominated in USD that must be spaced out over time.

The Optimistic Oracle is a powerful tool for smart contracts that need quick and secure resolution of any kind of off-chain data, and this tutorial is only scratching the surface.
