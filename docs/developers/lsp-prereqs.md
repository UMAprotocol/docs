## Clone the repo

1. Clone the repo:

 - [launch-lsp](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/launch-lsp)
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/UMAprotocol/launch-lsp.git
```
## Install the dependencies

You will need to install nodejs v14 (we recommend nvm to manage node versions) and yarn.

Note: these additional dependencies are required -- you may or may not have them on your system already:

- libudev
- libusb

These dependencies are installed on MacOS by installing the XCode Developer Tools. For Linux, the example ubuntu installation command for additional deps is:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

## Install packages

```bash
yarn
```

## Is your desired price identifier and collateral type supported?

Before deploying a contract, you should verify that your desired price identifier and collateral currency are already approved on the network you are trying to deploy to.
