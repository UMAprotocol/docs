One goal of developer mining program is that developers will try to attract capital to their contract by designing their own incentives program. Using the rewards that they receive from developer mining, a developer could grow the usage of their contract by rewarding behavior such as providing liquidity or having the community build specialized dapps. An example split of what a developer might use their rewards for would be:

- 10% as profit for the core contract development team
- 50% to liquidity mining
- 40% to other developers who build better dapps

Allocating rewards in such a way would allow a contract deployer to handle the financial design, contract deployment and initial bare-bones dapp creation, and then use $UMA rewards to incentivize token liquidity and improvements of their product/dapp experience.

Below is an example implementation of how a developer could technically implement their own liquidity mining or dapp mining program.

## Calculating APY for Liquidity Miners


## Implementing a dApp Mining Program
