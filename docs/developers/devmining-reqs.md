Before receiving rewards, a new developer mining participant must meet certain criteria. Meeting this criteria is intended to allow Risk Labs to allocate developer mining rewards correctly. This process is separate from initial whitelisting, and should be considered when a developer is ready to launch their contract. 

This is the high-level developer mining onboarding process that you will need to follow.

- If you have not done so already, apply to the developer mining [whitelist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPWOm4pNyqgDhXXr8wblWuSXXGslsGiJaFzrSNjN2RcG2RTQ/viewform).
- Ensure the availability of your price feed
- Ensure the availability of your synthetic token's price
- Send deployment information to the UMA core team
