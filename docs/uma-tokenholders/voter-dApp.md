sidebar_label: Voter dApp Tutorial
---

This tutorial describes how to vote using the [UMA voter dApp](https://vote.umaproject.org/). For context, each voting period is 48hrs. Voting takes 3 steps:
- Commit Vote: the first 24hrs of a voting period allows you to encrypt and commit your vote
- Reveal vote: the second 24hrs of a voting period allows you to decrypt and reveal your vote. Votes are tallied by a DVM smart contract at the end of the reveal period. 
- Claim rewards: At the end of each reveal period, you claim $UMA inflation rewards generated by the protocol, if you voted correctly as determined by the DVM.

You must commit `AND` reveal your vote in order for it to be counted
