UMA Improvement Proposals (UMIPs) are design documents used to propose changes to the UMA ecosystem. UMIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into the UMA protocol. 

UMIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of an implementation. Examples of common UMIPS include adding a new [collateral currency or price identifier](adding-price-id.md) to be supported by the DVM. UMIPs are presented to UMA tokenholders for voting through the voting dapp to determine whether they will be accepted or rejected.

UMIPs need to provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. They are modeled after [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/) and [ZEIPs](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-protocol-governance-voting-walkthrough-and-faq-3becfd57a370). See here for an [EIP template](https://blog.0xproject.com/0x-protocol-governance-voting-walkthrough-and-faq-3becfd57a370) and [ZEIP template](https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
