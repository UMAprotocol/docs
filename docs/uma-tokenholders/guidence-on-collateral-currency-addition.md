Collateral currencies can be added through the collateral currency UMIP template available on Github, by adding 

 - the name of the token to the be added 
 - the contract address of the token  together with a link to the address on etherscan
 - the amount that should be added to the store as final fee expressed in units of the intended collateral currency.   
_This should equate to approximately $400 at the time the UMIP is submitted.  If the token is not directly listed on Coingecko and/or Coinmarketcap, please add how the estimated dollar value of the token was obtained in the Rationale section._

***Note**: rebasing tokens cannot be added as collateral currencies as they do not work with UMA's factory contracts*

____________
The below provides some guidelines when using collateral currencies in an UMA contract

### Stablecoins

Consider carefully whether to treat stablecoins as their intended peg, or as the current market value.

### Non-traded tokens

Some tokens, such as interest bearing tokens or liquidity tokens may have no direct market.  

If using such tokens in a contract which requires collateral monitoring, such as Expiring Multiparty Contracts (EMP), please ensure that there is a clear way for liquidity to be obtained should it be required.  It may be useful to add this information to the UMIP, under the security section.

### Volatility

Where a proposed collateral type has high volatility, it is suggested that a higher store fee than the recommended $400 may be appropriate.

Where this is the case, this should be noted in the rationale section together with a justification for the value of the store fee.

### Liquidity

When there is little liquidity for a token, or where there is a low ratio of tokens available on the market compared with protocol treasury stores, care should be taken in using this collateral currency in a contract and developers should investigate the distribution schedule when considering its use.

### Bridged tokens
 
To be accepted as a collateral currency, there must be some availablilty of the token on the ethereum chain. 
 
Where the majority of the liquidity is available on another chain, including a sidechain, the UMIP should identify bridges where the collateral currency can be obtained. Note that any token and contract address added should be the ERC20 version, (not the token on the native chain)

Developers considering using such a currency for a contract that requires collateral monitoring should ensure that these bridges are robust enough to obtain sufficient collateral currency should it be required for liquidations.
