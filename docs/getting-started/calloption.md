A call options is a building block for the derivatives market. It gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy the asset at a specific price (strike) at a specific time.

## How options work

A buyer of an option buys a call option settling in 3 months for a strike price of $2000 for 1 ETH. In 3 months time if the price of ETH is above the $2000 then the buyer has made profit or is "In-The-Money", if the price is lower than $2000 the option is worthless or "Out-The-Money".
