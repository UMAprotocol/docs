UMA is an optimistic oracle that uses economic guarantees to secure markets. Unlike mechanically restrictive price feed oracles, an optimistic oracle is able to serve any arbitrary data on-chain. UMA’s flexible oracle serves data for uses including a cross-chain bridge, insurance, custom derivatives and prediction markets among other things.
 
The UMA Protocol also provides various smart contract templates that are automatically secured by its optimistic oracle. Among these are contract templates and integrations for creating synthetic tokens, predictions markets, "KPI options" and structured financial products.

## Integration Partners

Integration  | Website | Description 
------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
<img src="/network-icons/across-logo.png" width="150"/> | [Across](https://across.to/) | Across protocol is a novel bridging method that combines UMA's Optimistic Oracle with bonded relayers and single-sided liquidity pools to provide decentralized instant transactions from rollup chains to Ethereum mainnet.
<img src="/network-icons/polymarket-logo.png" width="150"/> | [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) | Polymarket is an information markets platform that lets you trade on the world’s most highly-debated topics. Polymarket supports UMA and its Optimistic Oracle as a resolution source for its markets. 
<img src="/network-icons/jarvis-logo.png" width="150"/> | [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network/) | Jarvis Network is a set of protocols on Ethereum allowing anyone to gain exposure to the price of any traditional or digital assets with stablecoins, against liquidity pools. Jarvis leverages UMA's Optimistic Oracle and DVM as its liquidation and dispute mechanism to ensure that jFIATs are properly collateralized.
<img src="/network-icons/sherlock-logo.png" width="150"/> | [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/) | Sherlock is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that protects users from smart contract exploits with proprietary security analysis and protocol-level coverage. UMA acts as an unbiased, decentralized arbiter for Sherlock where disputes are escalated to UMA's DVM and voted on to be resolved.
<img src="/network-icons/domfi-logo.png" width="150"/> | [Domination Finance](https://domination.finance/) | Domination Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) deployed on Ethereum and Polygon. Domination Finance uses UMA's Optimistic Oracle to enable users to speculate on popular market dominance metrics, such as Bitcoin Dominance (BTCDOM).
<img src="/network-icons/yam-logo.png" width="150"/> | [Yam Synths](https://synths.yam.xyz/) | Yam Synths is a powerful platform from the Yam DAO community providing easily accessible and innovative synthetic assets. UMA's Optimistic Oracle helps Yam to allow anyone in the world to access and trade cutting-edge synthetic products. 
<img src="/network-icons/hats-logo.png" width="150"/> | [Hats.finance](https://hats.finance/) | Hats.finance is a proactive bounty protocol for white hat hackers and auditors, where projects, community members, and stakeholders incentivize protocol security and responsible disclosure. Hat.Finance and UMA have collaborated on a product called protected tokens which enable users to recover funds in the event of a hack, bug, or other cause of lost funds.
