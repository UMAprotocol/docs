UMA stands for Universal Market Access. UMA is driven by a shared belief that financial markets should be free, open, and fair. The economic freedom created by a free and open market enables everyone equal opportunity to pursue prosperity and build financial independence.  

UMA's goal is to enable anyone to attain or transfer any form of risk seamlessly and securely through UMA protocol to empower everyone to participate in a universally accessible financial system.
