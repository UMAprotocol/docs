UMA is open-source infrastructure for deploying and enforcing synthetic assets on Ethereum. UMA enables developers to quickly and easily build synthetic tokens that track the price of anything! View [here](synthetic-tokens/what-are-synthetic-assets.md) to learn more about synthetic tokens!


## What infrastructure does UMA provide?

UMA enables developers to create synthetic assets via two core components:

- [Priceless financial contract templates](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/synthetic-tokens)
- [An optimistic oracle service](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/oracle)

Together, these two components enable the creation of fast, efficient, and secure synthetic derivatives on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Understanding UMA

If you would like to learn more about the concepts behind UMA's priceless financial contracts and optimistic oracle, start by reading this [overview](getting-started/overview.md) of the UMA ecosystem.

## For Developers

If you are a developer interested in building with UMA Protocol, view this [explainer](synthetic-tokens/what-are-synthetic-assets.md) of how UMA's priceless synthetic tokens work and to learn more about UMA's expiring synthetic tokens. 

Additionally, the [development guide](build-walkthrough/build-process) to learn how to launch your own expiring synthetic token on UMA. 

You can find additional reference materials, including a list of UMA's testnet and mainnet contracts [here](dev-ref/addresses.md).

## For UMA Tokenholders

If you are interested in the UMA project token, please read this [section](uma-tokenholders/uma-holders.md) to learn more about the role of the UMA project token in the DVM and the rights and responsibilities of UMA project tokenholders.
