## UMA is open-source infrastructure for deploying and enforcing synthetic assets on Ethereum

UMA enables developers to quickly and easily build synthetic tokens that track the price of anything! Synthetic tokens are collateral-backed tokens whose value fluctuates depending on the tokens’ reference index. Synthetic tokens blend features of prediction markets, futures markets, and collateralized loans.

Some examples of synthetic tokens include:

* Synthetic real-world assets (eg: gold or Tesla stock price)
* Synthetic cross-chain cryptoassets
* Tracking tokens for various non-tradable indices

## What infrastructure does UMA provide to developers?

UMA enables developers to create synthetic assets via two core components:

- [Priceless financial contract templates](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/synthetic-tokens)
- [An optimistic oracle service](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/oracle)

Together, these two components enable the creation of fast, efficient, and secure synthetic derivatives on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Understanding UMA

If you would like to learn more about the concepts behind UMA's priceless financial contracts and optimistic oracle, start by reading this [overview](getting-started/overview.md) of the UMA ecosystem.

## For Developers

If you are a developer interested in building with UMA’s technology, start with this [explainer](synthetic-tokens/explainer.md) of how UMA's priceless synthetic tokens work, and then try out this [tutorial](build-walkthrough/mint-locally) for how to deploy your own token on testnet. You can find additional reference materials, including a list of UMA-supported mainnet and testnet deployments, [here](dev-ref/addresses.md).

## For UMA Tokenholders

If you are interested in the UMA project token, please read this [section](uma-tokenholders/uma-holders.md) to learn more about the role of the UMA project token in the DVM and the rights and responsibilities of UMA project token holders.
